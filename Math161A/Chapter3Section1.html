<h1><u><b>Chapter 3 section 1 Notes</b></u></h1>
	<p>Definition: For a given sample space S of an experiment, a random variable (rv) X is a <u>function</u> that assigns every out come of S to exactly one real number. (add your image after this line)
	<br><u>Two types of rv's</u>
	<br><u>Discrete rv:</u> X is discrete if the set of possible values is finite or countably infinite
	<br><u>Continuous:</u> X is infinite

	<li><p>Starting at a ficed time, each car entering an intersection is observed to see whether it turns left (L) or right (R), or goes straight ahead (A). The experiment terminates as soon as a car is observed to turn left, Let X = the number of cars observed. What are possible X values? LIst five outcomes and their associated X values.</P>
