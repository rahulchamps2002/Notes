		<p>Consider the system of components connected as in the accompanying picture. Components 1 and 2 are connected in parallel so that subsystem works if either 1 or 2 workds; since 3 and 4 are connected in series that subsystem works if both 3 and 4 work. If components work independently of one another and P(component <i>i</i> works) = 0.9 for <i>i</i> = 1,2 and = 0.8 for <i>i</i> = 3,4, calculate {(system works).</p>
		<p>P(system works) = 1 - P(system fails)
	       <br>                = 1 - P(subsystem 1 fails &cap; subsystem 2 fails)
	       <br>                = 1 - P(subsystem 1 fails) * P(subsystem 2 fails)
	       <br>P(subsystem 1 fails) = P(comp 1 and 2 fail)
	       <br>(0.1)<sup>2</sup> = 0.01
	       <br>P(subsystem 2 fails) = 1 - P(subsystem 2 works)
	       <br>                     = 1 - P(comp 3 and 4 work)
	       <br>                     = 1 - (0.8)<sup>2</sup> = 0.36
	       <br>P(system works) = 1 - 0.01(0.36) = 1 - 0.0036 = 0.9964
	       <br>P(system works) = 0.9964

		<p>Consider purchasing a sustem of audio components consisting of a reveiver, a pair of speakers, and a CD player. Let A<sub>1</sub> be the event that the receiver functions properly throughout the warranty period, A<sub>2</sub> be the event that the speakers function properly throughout the warranty period, and A<sub>3</sub> be the event that the CD player functions properly throughout the warranty period. Suppose that these events are (mutually) independent with P(A<sub>1</sub>) = 0.95, P(A<sub>2</sub>) = 0.98, and P(A<sub>3</sub>) = 0.80.<br>
		<ol type="a">
			<li><p>What is the probability that all three components function properly throughout the warranty period?</p></li>
			<li><p>What is the probability that at least one component needs service during the warranty period?</p></li>
			<li><p>What is the probability that all three components need service during the warranty period?</p></li>
			<li><p>What is the probability that only the reciever will need servivce during the warranty period?</p></li>
