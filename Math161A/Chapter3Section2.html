<h1><b><u>Chapter 3 Section 2 Probabiliy of Discrete Random Variables (rv)</u></b></h1>
	<p>Definitions: The probability distribution of a discrete rv X (also known as the probability mass function (pmf)) is the function p<sub>X</sub>(x) = P(X=x), where x is <u>any</u> real number.
	<br>Note: &Sigma;<sub>x</sub>p(x) = 1
	<br>Ex. P(X = $2) = <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>36</sub> = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>
	<br>P(X = $5) = <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>36</sub> = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
	<br>P(X = -$10) = <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>36</sub> = <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>
	<br>The pmf:
	<pre>
	<br>	&nbsp; / <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>, x = 2
	<br>	/  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, x = 5
	<br>p(x)=<
	<br>	\  <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>, x = -10
	<br>	&nbsp; \ 0, otherwise

		<li><p>Airlines sometimes overbook flights. Suppose that for a plane with 50 seats, 55 passengers have tickets. Define the random variable <i>Y</i> as the number of ticketed passengers who actually show up for the flight. The probability mass function of <i>Y</i> as the number of ticketed passengers who actually show up for the flight. The probability mass fucntion of <i>Y</i> appears in the accompanying table.</p>
