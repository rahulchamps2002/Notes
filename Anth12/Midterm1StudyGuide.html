	<h3><u>Chapter 1</u></h3>
	<ol>
		<li>What is Biological Anthropology? What principles does it use?
		<br>Biological Anthropology is about studying how humans and their close relatives are different and similar in terms of bodies and genes. Principles: It follows some rules - like looking at how things have changed over time, considering everything about humans, understanding how they adapt to survive, and studying how traits are passed from parents to kids.
		</li>
		<li>What are the subfields of Anthropology?
		<br>Anthropology has different parts. We have cultural anthropology (looking at how people live), archaeology (digging up old stuff), linguistic anthropology (studying how language is used), and biological anthropology.
		</li>
		<li>Name the different related disciplines under Biological Anthropology and explain what they study.
		<br>In Biological Anthropology, we have parts like primatology (studying monkeys and apes), human evolutionary biology (learning about how humans changed over a long time), paleoanthropology (looking at old human fossils), and human biology (seeing how different groups of people today are different biologically).
		</li>
		<li>What is the scientific method? Explain the components of the scientific method. What is an empirical process?
		<br>The scientific method is like a step-by-step way scientists figure out answers to questions or problems.
Components: First, you look at something interesting. Then, you ask a clear question about it. After that, you make a guess (hypothesis) about the answer. Next, you do tests to check if your guess is right. You write down what you see and measure during the tests (data collection). Then, you look at your notes to figure out what they mean (analysis). Finally, you sum up what you found out (conclusion).
Empirical Process: It means using evidence from watching, measuring, or testing things directly instead of just thinking about it. It's like saying, "I know because I saw it happen!"

			<br>It is the change of phenotypes that leads to an overarching mutation for a certain environment.
