		<li>Sex is the single thread that connects us to the ancestors</li>
		<li>Males: courage, grace, and care</li>
		<li>Males rarely stay for the growth of the children in the wild</li>
		<li>males play a critical role in reproduction</li>
		<li>the role must have a vital role</li>
		<li>Rober Brinehook is someone who has been researching about sexual intercourse and the disease that you could develop.</li>
		<li>Asexual species were more likely to be infected with a parasite but there is potential for it to be by the </li>
		<li>Red Queen idea: does evolution ever stop if it is in the perfect condition. "You have to keep running as fast as you can to be in the position you are in.</li>
		<li>The asexual fishes stopped evolving and were being taken out by the parasites.</li>
		<li>The non-asexual fishes kept developing new genes as they had both father and mother genes</li>
		<li>Eventually the sexual fishes were being decimated by the parasites because they were more clone like to each other</li>
		<li>The more the genetic variation is, the more likely the fish would be resistant to the parasites.</li>
		<li>Men are like the insurance policy for the females to stop diseases from killing her children</li>
		<li>Eggs are more complex than sperm; that is why there are more sperms than eggs</li>
		<li>Eggs choose which sperm they would be willing to let in</li>
		<li>"The sight of a peacock makes me sick." --Charles Darwin</li>
		<li>Darwin does not see what the reason for peacock's tails are for as they are basically inhibiting the survival chances of the brid</li>
		<li>Charles believed that there had to be an evolutionary process to the growth of the animal</li>
		<li>Darwin creates the idea of <u>Sexual Selection</u></li>
		<li>Males compete for resources, food, territory, or courtship</li>
		<li>Females are choice</li>
		<li>Males dress and displays themselves more nicely so that women would choose them</li>
		<li>In peacocks, they seem to be more willing to mate with those who would </li>
		<li>Paternity matters when it comes to survival</li>
		<li>Females may sometimes choose the mate that is willing to stick around instead of the one that has the better genes because the female alone cannot take care of the offsprings</li>
		<li>The male only stays if there is certainty that the offsprings are his</li>
		<li>This created monogamy</li>
		<li>Monogamy is difficult to maintain</li>
		<li>Such as the song birds, there are some who would cheat and break the monogomous relationship</li>
		<li>this creates a chance for their offsprings to have better genes</li>
		<li>For the Chicano birds, there is a gender reversal</li>
		<li>Chicano males would stay back and take care fo the children after they are born</li>
		<li>In the Chicano birds, females compete for mates instead of the males competing for females</li>
		<li>When a female Chicano bird takes over the territory of a vanquished bird, they break and kill all the offsprings</li>
		<li>In chimpanzees, there is a lot of violence and aggression</li>
		<li>In bonobos, there is more kindness and care</li>
		<li>Chimpanzees are very patriartical and would commonly abuse the female</li>
		<li>Rape is common in chimpanzees</li>
		<li>Bonobos are very sexually active</li>
		<li>there is a lot of different forms of sexual actions</li>
		<li>Females developed a strategy to keep males more calm</li>
		<li>This strategy has formed a mor ecalmer society for the females and more enjoyable sexual interactions</li>
		<li>This strategy came from the fact that they had to gather for food on the floors of the forest and not in the trees like the chimpanzee</li>
		<li>We have the ability to smell a readiness of a person for sexual acts</li>
		<li>This is because we can smell good genes</li>
		<li>Things that feel good are inherently because of the need for good genes</li>
		<li>For the women, they would look for the kind of person who had more masculine face when it comes to short relationships</li>
		<li>Survival Selection vs Sexual Selection</li>
                <li>Survival Selection: the selection of a mate who has the best genes and would be most likely to take care of the offsprings</li>
                <li>There is a heavy connection between culture and human brains</li>
