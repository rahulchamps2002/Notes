<header><b>STEM Environment Reflection</b></header>
	<p>When it comes to a STEM environment, I personally do not believe that it is a hostile environment. However, there were moments in time that people were in a sense, toxic with the way that people communicate. Some women that I am close to, feel as if they are looked down upon if they do not know or understand a concept. I personally have also been looked down upon by people in the STEM community. Despite these experiences, there have been more positive experiences I have seen and was a part of.

	<br>A hostile environment means a place where there is no friendly interactions and constant discrimination against a group or a person. On average, there is not a lot of hostility in the workplace but there are times where there are racist interactions that occur. At a time, I was looked down upon due to the unhealthy and untrue racial stereotype that Asian Indians smell fowl. The sterotype made me feel uncomfortable and outcasted as I would believe that I would have an unpleasant odor although I followed a strict and proper hygienic practice.

	<br>The idea of putting a pause on the push for minorities to join a hostile science is not the best idea in my opinion. My reasoning is because there needs a stand against these hostile thoughts towards the minority groups. By pushing more into the hostile science, they can change the view of those who are hostile by becoming the leaders of that science. The best way to combat a stereotype is proving it otherwise. By stopping the push for joining the ‘hostile science,’ we are effectively aiding the upliftment of those hostile natures. These hostile groups would continue to push their narratives to gain what they would want.

	<br>Some solutions include the help of management and of the workers themselves. To stop hostility, management should reprimand those who are hostile. If management is hostile, workers must combat them to bring hostility to a halt. Other solutions include defying the restraints that society is placing upon those who are being considered marginalized, oppressed, and are victims to hostile science environments.
