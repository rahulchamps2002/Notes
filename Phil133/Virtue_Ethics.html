	<h1><u><b>Virtue Ethics</b></u></h1>
	<h2><u>The Basics</u></h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Virtue = "A tendency or disposition, cultivated by habit, to have appropriate beliefs and feelings and to act accordingly" (Tiberius, 2015, p. 109).</li>
		<li>Lying in the mean - between two extremes</li>
		<li>Obtained through the "right education" (The good person takes pleasure in doing virtuous acts)</li>
		<li>Nature AND habit as important components</li>
		<li>Important for flourishing (the good life)</li>
		<li>It is difficult to find the mean
			<ul>
				<li>And we ought to be skeptical of pleasure especially: "Now in everything the pleasant or pleasure..."</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Connection with Character
			<ul>
				<li>Within the contemporary literature, virtues are often thought of as being th esame as or similar to character traits</li>
				<li>When we speak about people behaving morally, we odten appeal to character/make ascriptions of character</li>
				<li>"Just think while you've been getting down about the liars, and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world..."</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>What are we doing when we make character ascriptions?
			<ul>
				<li>Explaining: If we know that someone has a particular character trait, and we take chracter traits to be stable across situations, we can predict what they are going to do.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2><u>What are the Objections?</u></h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The Challenge from Situationism
			<ul>
				<li>The Milgram Experiment, 1961
					<ul>
						<li>Tested obedience to see how good standing people can still do bad things to people</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Situationism as an alternative to the Aristotelian coneption of moral psychology
			<ul>
				<li>"Behavioral variation owes more to situational differences than dispositional differences</li>
				<li>A related issue: Nudging
					<ul>
						<li>Subtly changing the environment can affect a person's behavior</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
